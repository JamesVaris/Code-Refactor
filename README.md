# Code Refactor 

This is the README file for the code refactor challenge to simplify and refact the mockup for Horiseon.

The user story is:


AS A marketing agency 
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibitliy standards 
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines 


The Acceptance criteria is:


GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards 

WHEN I view the source code 

THEN I find semantic HTML elements 

WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements 

THEN I find that the elements follow a logical sturcture independent of styling and positioning 

WHEN I view the image elements 

THEN I find accessible alt attributes 

WHEN I view the heading attirbutes 

THEN they fall in sequential order 

WHEN I view the title element 

THEN I find a concise, descriptive tile 

HERE is the MockUp:

These are the changes I have made to the webpage:

Changing semantic elements to improve clairity

Simplified the CSS by using the same class name for matching styles in the HTML

Added comments to HTML and CSS

Added alt tags to all images

Fixed the missing id tag for items in the nav section
